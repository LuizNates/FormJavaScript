# FormJavaScript
A form with JavaScript to train my skills.


In this exercise I needed to create a interactime form that showed to the person who was using it a path to start the IT studies.
First of all I made all the HTML and CSS, them I changed the display of the most part of the code to "none", then I added the JavaScript
that change the display when the user click in the answer.
